<h1>Portfolio Optimization with Heuristics and PSO</h1>
<p>This university project explores the application of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to solve portfolio optimization problems under constraints, such as the Markowitz mean-variance framework and mixed-integer constraints. It evaluates portfolio performance using advanced risk measures like Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES), comparing results with traditional optimization methods. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of heuristic techniques in enhancing portfolio efficiency and risk management, providing practical insights for asset allocation strategies.</p>
